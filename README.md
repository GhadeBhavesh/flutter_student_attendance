# Flutter Student Attendance Application

This project is a simple Student Attendance Application that allows users to select a class and section using dropdown menus and view a list of students with their current attendance status and entry time. 
Users can mark attendance by clicking on a student’s name, which opens a popup for selecting "Present" or "Absent."

   Each list item includes:
   - Student's name

   - Entry time.

# 3. Attendance Marking
   
- Clicking a student’s name opens a popup.
